                <h2>1971 - S.I.L</h2>
                <h3>Businessman and Investor</h3>
                <div class="startingpara">
                    <p class="paragraph">Musk was born in Pretoria to model Maye and businessman and engineer Errol Musk, 
                        and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring
                        citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University
                        at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's
                        degrees in economics and physics.<br><br>
                        He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with 
                        his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for
                        $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 
                        to form PayPal. In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made
                        from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.</p>

            <h3>The folllowing list is the timeline of Elon Musk's life</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Creates Blastar</li>
                <p class="ab">At the age of 12, Musk programmed and sold a space-themed video game called Blastar for $500, showing early interest and talent in computing and technology. You can play the game online and see what Blastar is about.</p>
                <li><strong>1989</strong> - Moves to Canada</li>
                <p class="ac"></p>Seeking better opportunities, Musk emigrated to Canada, using his mother’s citizenship to simplify the process. He moved to Canada to avoid mandatory service in the South African military and to enroll at Queen’s University (aged 17). The same year, he obtained his Canadian citizenship.<br><br>
                <li><strong>1992</strong> - Goes to Penn, Stanford</li>
                <p class="ad">In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degree in economics and pursued a second bachelor’s in physics. After Penn, he enrolled at Stanford for a PhD in energy physics, but the timing coincided with the Internet boom, so he dropped out after two days to join the expanding tech industry.</p>
                <li><strong>1995</strong> - Founds Zip2 Corporation</li>
                <p class="ae">In 1995, Musk co-founded Zip2 Corporation with his brother, Kimbal Musk. Zip2 was an online city guide, providing business directories and maps for newspapers. The company developed software that allowed newspapers to offer additional commercial services to their readers, such as online guides and directory listings with maps. This innovation helped businesses reach a broader audience through the internet. Elon secured contracts with major newspapers like The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, which strengthened the company’s</p>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> - Sells Zip2</li>
                <p class="af">In 1999, Musk sold Zip2 to Compaq for nearly $300 million and co-founded X.com. This was Musk’s first significant financial success. Elon received $22 million from the sale, which he used to fund his subsequent ventures, including X.com, an online payment company that would later become PayPal.</p>
                <li><strong>2000</strong> - Marries Justine Wilson</li>
                <p class="ag">In January 2000, Elon Musk married his first wife Justine Wilson, whom he met while attending Queen’s University in Canada. The couple had 6 kids before divorcing in 2008 after 8 years of marriage.</p>
                <li><strong>2000</strong> - X.com merges with Confinity to form PayPal</li>
                <p class="ah">In 2000, Elon Musk’s online banking company X.com merged with the money transfer firm Confinity to create PayPal. The merger combined X.com’s online banking technology with Confinity’s money transfer capabilities to form an online payment platform. PayPal’s grew rapidly and was adopted as a facilitator of e-commerce transactions.</p>

                <p class="ai">In 2002, Elon Musk became a U.S. citizen, so he could pursue business opportunities in America.</p>
                <li><strong>2002</strong> - First child is born, passes away</li>
                <p class="aj">The same year, Elon Musk’s first child was born: a son named Nevada Alexander Musk. Tragically, Nevada passed away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at just 10 weeks old. This devastating loss led Musk and his then-wife Justine to pursue IVF treatments, resulting in the births of twins and triplets in subsequent years.</p>
                <li><strong>2002</strong> - Sells PayPal, Founds SpaceX</li>
                <p class="ak">eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in eBay stock on October 3, 2002. This was shortly after PayPal first sold shares to the public. Over 70% of eBay auctions took PayPal payments at that time, around 1 out of every 4 successful eBay auctions using PayPal.

                    After being ousted as the CEO of PayPal, Musk became interested in space exploration.  Believing that making human life possible on Mars was imperative for the future of humanity, Musk was concerned that NASA lacked plans for a human mission to Mars. He then attended space conferences, funded private space projects, and even considered growing a plant on Mars as a publicity stunt. 
                    
                    However, after failed attempts to obtain a missile for a Mars mission, he decided to build his own rocket. In the same year, using the funds from the PayPal sale, Musk founded SpaceX with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars.</p>              
                <li><strong>2002</strong> - The Musk Foundation</li>
                <p class="al">In 2002, Elon Musk founded the Musk Foundation as a nonprofit organization. Its stated goals were aimed to support renewable energy, pediatric research, education, and safe artificial intelligence. From 2002 to 2018, it donated about $25 million, with almost half going to OpenAI, a company owned by Musk. According to a Daily Mail article, “the world’s second-richest man has escaped billions in tax by gifting Tesla stock to the Musk Foundation”.</p>

                <p class="an">Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, with the goal of producing electric vehicles. Elon Musk began his involvement in the electric vehicle industry by making a significant financial investment and joining the company’s board of directors as chairman.

                    Under Musk’s leadership, Tesla has expanded into solar energy, battery production, and self-driving tech, while he uses his public influence to advocate for Tesla’s sustainability mission. As an engineer with physics and computer science expertise, Musk directly shapes Tesla’s engineering decisions on electric vehicles, batteries, and self-driving AI, fostering a culture of rapid iteration and technological boundary-pushing.</p>

                <p class="ao">On January 1, triplets Damian, Saxon, and Kai Musk were born to Elon and Justine Musk.</p>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> - SolarCity is founded</li>
                <p class="ap">In 2006, Elon Musk co-founded SolarCity with his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive, a company that provided solar energy services. The aim was to make solar energy affordable and widespread, aligning with Musk’s vision for sustainable energy. In late 2015, SolarCity stopped offering solar panel sales and installation services in Nevada after the state’s Public Utilities Commission made changes that increased monthly charges for rooftop solar customers and reduced the compensation they received for selling excess solar energy back to the grid through net metering.</p>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - Divorces first wife, Justine Musk</li>
                <p class="aq">In an essay that Justine wrote for Marie Claire, she recounted how their marriage got sour and how Elon said to her at one time: ‘If you were my employee,’ he said just as often, ‘I would fire you.’”</p>

                <li><strong>2020</strong> - X Æ A-12 Musk is born</li>
                <p class="be">X Æ A-12 Musk, born on May 4, 2020, is the first son of the Musk-Grimes couple. His unconventional name initially caused quite a stir; it was originally spelled as “X Æ A-12,” but the last part was later changed to Roman numerals, making it “X Æ A-Xii.” Musk said the name is pronounced “X Ash A Twelve.” In an interview for Vanity Fair, Grimes pronounced the name “X A.I. Archangel,”, or “X” or “Little X” for short.
                         <br><br>
                    <strong>The name means, as tweeted by Grimes:<br></strong>
                    
                    “X, the unknown variable” [commonly used in mathematical equations. It represents enigmatic and limitless possibilities.]
                    “Æ, my elven spelling of Ai (love &or Artificial Intelligence)”
                    “A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft).  No weapons, no defenses, just speed.  Great in battle, but non-violent”

                    “(X metal rat)”</p>
                <li><strong>2020</strong> - Tesla became the world’s most valuable carmaker</li>
                <p class="bf">In July 2020, Tesla overtook Japan’s Toyota to become the world’s most valuable carmaker. Its stock reached a record high of $1,134, giving Tesla a market value of approximately $209.47 billion, which was about $4 billion more than Toyota’s market value. Tesla’s stock surged due to its leadership in the electric vehicle market, strategic model launches, strong financial performance, advancements in battery technology, inclusion in the S&P 500, Elon Musk’s influence, and market sentiment.

                    In 2024, Mercedes-Benz has reclaimed its position as the world’s most valuable automobile brand, with a brand value that increased by 1% to reach $59.4 billion.</p>

                <p class="bi">Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, born in December 2021, is the second child of the Musk-Grimes couple. Her unique and cosmic-inspired name combines scientific, cosmic, and literary elements. 

                    While her parents affectionately refer to her as “Y”, the unusual , complex name “Exa Dark Sideræl” was explained by her mother in an interview for Vanity Fair:</p>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li><strong>Exa </strong>refers to the supercomputing term exaFLOPS, which represents the ability to perform 1 quintillion floating-point operations per second. It’s a nod to cutting-edge computational power.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dark </strong>is the “the unknown. People fear it but truly it’s the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe,” Grimes explained.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sideræl</strong>is pronounced as “sigh-deer-ee-el,” and relates to star time and deep space time, not our relative Earth time. The name also pays tribute to Galadriel, a character from The Lord of the Rings.</li>    <br>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>2021</strong> - First all-private civilian crew (Inspiration4)</li>

                <p class="bl">SpaceX’s first fully integrated Starship was launched on April 20, 2023, from SpaceX’s Starbase facility at Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. The Starship, standing at an impressive 394 feet (120 meters), powered by 33 first-stage Raptor engines, was the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built. Although the flight ended in an intentional explosion, after multiple issues, reaching an altitude of about 24 miles (39 kilometers) was a significant achievement.</p>
                <li><strong>2023</strong> - Techno Musk is born</li>
                <p class="bm">In September 2023, a review of Isaacson’s biography of Elon Musk in the New York Times disclosed that Musk and Grimes had welcomed a third child named Techno. Grimes talks about Techno in a post on X: “I wish I could show u how cute little Techno is, but my priority rn is keeping my babies out of the public eye.”

                    Techno is the 11th child officially acknowledged to be fathered by Elon Musk so far. Looks like Elon’s really going for his own fleet to start a colony on Mars!</p>
                <li><strong>2024</strong> - 3rd Starship test flight success</li>
                <p class="bn">During SpaceX’s third test flight of the Starship rocket on March 14, 2024, the megarocket reached orbital speed, with both the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket booster performing better than in previous tests.
